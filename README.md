DishSnitch: The "Who Left Dirty Dishes in the Sink" Detector
By: Elad Shapira, Stephan Gross & Yarden Tzemach

Dirty dishes! Our team is dealing with an abundance of those. Argh!

Which brought our researchers to develop a DishSnitch. 
Yeah, an automated app that detects and shames the culprit by sending the full evidence—including pics—to the company’s dedicated Slack. 
**Face palm**

For those who are interested in the DishSnitch, we placed the app’s files free to grab on Github—you’ll find the link at the end of the post.

Introduction

This project was the culmination of an exciting two-day hackathon at Panorays, Panackathon. 
The idea was that teams work on a dedicated project related to the company, under the theme of automation. 
Considering that the dishes take up nerves, time and, well, smell bad, for the benefit of the company, we just had to create this DishSnitch. 
Together with me, this app was developed by Stephan Gross and Yarden Zemach, members of the Security team. 
(Necessary pat-on-the- back note: We actually developed in these two days two separate unrelated automation projects. 
The other project we worked on will be integrated within the Panorays platform shortly. Exciting times!)
